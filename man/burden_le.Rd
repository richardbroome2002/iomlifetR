\title{An implementation of the IOM life expectancy spreadsheets}
\usage{
burden_le(demog_data, min_age_at_risk = 30, pm_concentration = 1,
  RR = 1.06, unit = 10, neonatal_deaths = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{demog_data}{A data frame with columns of headed "age" (the age at which each age group begins), "population" (the size of the population) and "deaths" (the number of deaths in the population).}

\item{min_age_at_risk}{Numeric vector. The lowest age susceptible to air pollution.}

\item{pm_concentration}{A number. The population weighted-mean PM2.5 concentration of interest.}

\item{RR}{A number. Specifies the relative risk from an epidemiologiccal study.}

\item{unit}{A number. Speficies the unit change associated with the relative risk (RR).}

\item{neonatal_deaths}{Logical. Are neonatal deaths included?}

\item{start_age}{A numeric vector. The starting age of each age group}
}
\value{
A list of 3 elements:
\itemize{
  \item{The difference (between the baseline and impacted population) in:}
    \itemize{
      \item{Age-specific life expectancy (days)}
      \item{Age-specific life-years lived per 100,000}
      \item{Age-specific number of  deaths per 100,000}
      }
  \item{The baseline life table}
  \item{The impacted life table}}
}
\description{
Calculate the change in life expectancy associated with a reduction in risk of death
}
